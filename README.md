This plugin had one point, which was to copy and paste multiple things via dragging (First in, last out order). This was made primarily just a way for me to have fun. It's evolved into a tool that I would like to keep on me at all times. 

There's not a lot of creature comforts at the moment, the usual help, FAQ's and/or help hints.

The usage is as follows:

Set which keys to copy and/or paste as you drag your mouse over text content. You can set them to be the same key, but I wouldn't recommend it. It'll work, just not in any meaningful way.

The "Keep" option will allow the current buffer of text to remain. It'll paste through the entire stack, but regenerate the stack when you're done. Keeping it on will also prevent any new items from being put into the stack.

The "HL Cp" is "Highlight Copy". This makes it so that when you highlight text, it'll copy it into the stack. Again, will do nothing if "Keep" is turned on.

Hidden function. Alt+V will paste the last item in the stack. If "Keep" is turned on, this will perpetually be the last thing. If not, it'll decrement the stack.
